**Definitions**

1. Convolution - A layer used for extracting features from an input image.

2. Filters/Kernels - A 3x3 matrix utilized to extract feature/s from an image.

3. Epochs- The number of times we go through the dataset while training the neural network.

4. 1x1 Convolution - Convolving the image by 1x1 matrix.

5. 3x3 Convolution - Convolving the input image by 3x3 matrix.

6. Feature maps is a map or collection of features.

7. Activation function - In a network, for a set of inputs, the activation function gives the output of kernel. Eg - ReLU.

8. Receptive field - A specific feature we want to extract from a particular region in the input image.
